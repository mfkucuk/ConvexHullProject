# CS478 - Convex Hull Construction Algorithms and Comparing Their Performance
## How to run
The project can run with local hosting. You can use:
- **live-server**
- **http-server**

Navigate to the project root folder. Then run either `live-server .` or `http-server .` to start the project.

OR,

The project is being is hosted using **gh-pages**, and you can access it [here](https://mfkucuk.github.io/ConvexHullProject/#).

## How to use
- You can click on the screen to place new points.
- You can also add points by using the circular buttons at the right.
- You can select which algorithm will run from the combo box at the top left.
- You can run the algorithm by clicking on the run button which will run the currently selected algorithm.
- **Clear Points** will clear the whole canvas.
- **Reset Hull** will clear the hull but not the points.
- If you enable the checkbox to be **Animated**, currently selected algorithm will run with animation.
- You can adjust the animation speed by using the slider at the top right.
- Finally, the timer will tell you how much the algorithm took to execute.
